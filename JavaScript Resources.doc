Programming styles are like writing styles – some are clear and transparent, others are dense and impenetrable. In this course, you’ll see code that favors clarity and simplicity. 

In addition to the videos and coding exercises you experience in this course, you may want to review additional resources to dig deeper or get exposure to other coding conventions. Dr. Williams and Dr. Sanchez recommend the following resources for supplementary reading and practice:

Our Recommendations

To take full advantage of this unique course, we advise the following:

Stay up to date. The course is rich with insights, which you can benefit from only if you allocate a sufficient amount
of time to it. Make sure you stay up to date with the modules and assignments and apply what you’ve learned to your 
own work as you proceed. 

Interact with your classmates. The course will fly by and the nine weeks will be gone before you know it. 
Reach out early to your classmates to build connections. Share your experiences and learn from your peers.

Put it into practice. One of our key objectives is to give you actionable resources that you can implement within 
your area of work. To achieve that, you’ll need to apply what you are learning, which is why we encourage you to complete
the assignments in each module. The more you practice, the more you’ll learn and the more effective you’ll be.
